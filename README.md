# Medits_ISDbayes_commercial_species
Fishing and warming reshape the central Mediterranean. Using 2000â€“2023 size spectra for nine species (3 fish, 3 crustaceans, 3 cephalopods), we show joint stressors shrink fish sizes and biomass, while crustaceans/cephalopods respond differently, reflecting plasticity. Management should integrate climate and fishing to sustain resilience.
